Every morning, I look out the window,
People running beside the willow.
Seeing people biking with their families,
I relieve those memories,
Of when I was with my parents
Learning, quarreling, and receiving presents.
Sudden burst of colors,
Thoughts, feelings, and others
Shades of green, yellow, and red.
Clouding my mind as I read.
And my mind twirled
Sipping a cup of coffee, brings me back to the real world.
